# Licensing Guide for Boxwise

This document provides guidance on the Boxwise Proprietary License and its implementation throughout the project.

## License Overview

The Boxwise project uses a proprietary license that:

1. Allows **personal, non-commercial use** only
2. Prohibits redistribution of the software
3. Prohibits commercial use, including selling the software or derivative works
4. Provides the software "as is" without warranties

## Why This License?

This license was chosen to:
- Protect the intellectual property of the Boxwise project
- Prevent unauthorized commercial exploitation of the codebase
- Allow individual users to use the software for personal purposes
- Maintain control over the distribution and use of the software

## License Implementation

The license is implemented through:

1. **LICENSE file**: The full license text in the repository root
2. **README mention**: Clear statement in the README about the licensing terms
3. **License headers**: Template provided for adding to source files
4. **This documentation**: Explaining the licensing approach

## Enforcement Considerations

While the license sets legal terms for using the software, enforcement requires active monitoring and potentially legal action:

1. **Monitoring**: Regularly search for unauthorized uses or distributions of the software
2. **Documentation**: Maintain records of your copyright ownership and development history
3. **Communication**: Often, a simple notification about license violation is enough to resolve issues
4. **Legal counsel**: For serious violations, consult with legal professionals specializing in software licensing

## Dependency Considerations

Boxwise uses various third-party libraries, each with its own license. When adding new code:

1. Verify that third-party library licenses are compatible with your proprietary approach
2. Keep track of all dependencies and their licenses
3. Comply with the terms of all third-party licenses

## Sharing the Repository

Since the repository is public on GitHub:
1. The license legally restricts how others can use the code, even though they can view it
2. For additional protection of truly sensitive code, consider keeping certain modules in private repositories
3. Remember that the best protection for truly valuable intellectual property is often through patents, not just licensing

## Future Licensing Options

If project requirements change, consider:

1. **Dual licensing**: Offering both proprietary and commercial licenses
2. **Time-limited restrictions**: Using licenses that allow commercial use after a certain period (like BSL)
3. **Open-source transition**: Moving to a more permissive license if the business model changes

## License Headers Implementation

To systematically add license headers to key files, consider:

1. Starting with the most important source files
2. Using automation tools to add headers to multiple files at once
3. Including header addition in your development workflow for new files
